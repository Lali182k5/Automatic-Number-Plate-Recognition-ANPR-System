# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-ANPR-System


📌 Project Description:

   This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System that detects and extracts text from vehicle number plates using OpenCV and EasyOCR. It processes images or live video feeds to identify and recognize vehicle registration numbers, which can then be used for various applications such as traffic management, security monitoring, parking systems, and automated toll collection.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python 🐍 – Core programming language

OpenCV 👀 – For image processing and object detection

EasyOCR 📝 – For Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

NumPy 🔢 – For handling image arrays
